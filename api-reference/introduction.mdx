## API Playground

The playground in next sections allow you learn and test the API against a real Nhost instance.


To learn how to start a local Nhost instance head to [local development](/local-development)

```bash
> nhost up

Nhost development environment started.
URLs:
- Postgres:             postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/local
- Hasura:               https://local.hasura.nhost.run
- GraphQL:              https://local.graphql.nhost.run
- Auth:                 https://local.auth.nhost.run
- Storage:              https://local.storage.nhost.run
- Functions:            https://local.functions.nhost.run
- Dashboard:            https://local.dashboard.nhost.run
- Mailhog:              https://local.mailhog.nhost.run

SDK Configuration:
 Subdomain:             local
 Region:                (empty)

Run `nhost up` to reload the development environment
Run `nhost down` to stop the development environment
